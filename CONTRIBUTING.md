# Contributing to Megadraft
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

## We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), so all code changes happen through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/globocom/megadraft/issues/new/choose)
All of our issues have a template with tips for describing the problem. Try to follow the proposed structure, this helps the reviewer a lot.
